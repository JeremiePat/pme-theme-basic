# Text size modifier

Slides or individual elements can have a text modifier (a class) to adjust the font size in order to better fit the slide content.

Super extra large font size (class: .font-xxl) <!-- .element: class="font-xxl" -->

Extra large font size (class: .font-xl) <!-- .element: class="font-xl" -->

Large Font size (class: .font-l) <!-- .element: class="font-l" -->

Medium Font size (class: .font-m) (default) <!-- .element: class="font-m" -->

Small font size (class: .font-s) <!-- .element: class="font-s" -->

Extra small font size (class: .font-xs) <!-- .element: class="font-xs" -->

Super extra small font size (class: .font-xxs) <!-- .element: class="font-xxs" -->
