# iframe (grid)

In grid layout, iframe are always maximized to display as much content as possible. We suggest using the 1-2 or 2-1 layout to give more space to the iframe.

<iframe src="https://sass-lang.com"></iframe>

# iframe (default)

In default layout, iframe must have the class "stretch" to be maximized properly

<iframe src="https://sass-lang.com" class="stretch"></iframe>

<!-- .slide: class="grid no-bullet margin" -->
# image and list (grid)

- In grid layout image are placed inside their layout slot (because there are usually wrapped inside a &lt;p&gt; element). However, it is possible to use the class "stretch" to maximized the image.
- If the slot has a size ratio different from the image, the image will fit in and it will be centered accordingly.
- Last but not least, you can abuse the HTML list semantic to have the list looks like paragraphs by using the `no-bullet` and `margin` class.
